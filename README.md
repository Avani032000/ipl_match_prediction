Whatâ€™s Inside? 

Data Preprocessing & Cleaning: Handling raw IPL match and deliveries datasets to ensure accuracy and consistency.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing trends, team performances, and correlations to uncover match-winning patterns.
Feature Engineering: Constructing key match variables like current run rate, required run rate, and wickets in hand to improve model performance.
Machine Learning Models: Implementing Linear Regression and Logistic Regression to predict match winners.
Real-Time Match Tracking: Analyzing how win probabilities evolve throughout an IPL game.

Tech Stack

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn),
Jupyter Notebook for analysis and visualization,
Machine Learning for predictive modeling


Future Enhancements

Incorporating real-time data streams for live match predictions.
Exploring advanced ML techniques such as XGBoost and Neural Networks.
Integrating additional datasets (weather, pitch conditions, player stats).
